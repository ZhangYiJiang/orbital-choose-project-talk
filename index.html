          <h2>Every project is different</h2>
          <p>So what is right for me?</p>
          
          <aside class="notes">So let's get to it. Orbital is quite flexible when it 
            comes to the type of project you can choose to build. We know that every project

            <li>...and anything else you can imagine</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">So let's get to it. Orbital is quite flexible when it
            comes to the type of project you can choose to build, because we know

            Rank them according to what you think is important, then see how closely
            the project type you're thinking of matches up.</aside>

          <h3>Reach and accessibility</h3> 
          <p>Who can access or use your project, and is it easy to do so?</p>
          
          <aside class="notes">Reach and accessibility is important if you're 
            building you actually want people to use. It's less important if
            your project is a toy project or a portfolio piece. In general,
            the more platforms your app is on, and the less steps there are
            before the user can actually get productive with it - for instance, 
            require creating an account or installing something, the more likely
            it is for them to actually use your app.</aside>

          <h3>Educational</h3>
          <p>What do you learn from building the project?</p>
          
          <aside class="notes">For many of you this will be your first time 
            building an actual app, so it's good to consider what you yourself
            will get out of the experience. Also consider how the project will
            look in your resume or portfolio. If this is not a 'real' app, you 
            can take more liberty in choosing the newest technology, instead of
            something realistic.</aside>

          <h3>Development experience</h3>
          <p>Is it fun or easy to build? Is it expensive?</p>
          
          <aside class="notes">Often overlooked, your own experience as a developer
            does matter. A good development experience will keep you motivated.</aside>

          <p>What do existing apps use?</p> 
          <p>Why did they choose it, and should you try to differentiate?</p>
          
          <aside class="notes">Another frequently overlooked method for evaluating
            just about anything is look at your competitors. Your ideas are most
            likely original, so see what others before you have done (and if there aren't
            maybe you should ask yourself <em>why</em> that's the case. You can learn
            a lot from your competition - and not just to copy, but also to
            <em>differentiate</em> yourself.</aside>

            In traditional web applications the server will handle the business logic,

          <h3 class="pro">Pros</h3>
          <p><strong>Reach</strong> - Easily cross platform</p>
          
          <aside class="notes">The biggest advantage of building web apps is that they can
            be accessed from any device - desktop, mobile, smart TVs - anything with a 
            browser, really.</aside>

          <p><strong>Accessible</strong> - No installation required</p>
          
          <aside class="notes">There's also no need to install anything, which is great
            because the biggest barrier to users these days is installing the app,
            and creating an account. Web apps just removed one of the two steps.</aside>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3 class="pro">Pros</h3>
          <p><strong>Easy to learn</strong> - start simple, learn as you go along</p>
          
          <aside class="notes">This is subjective, but in my opinion, HTML and CSS at least 
            are very easy to learn. That's all you need for a simple website. And if you
            want your website to do more, simply pick up more skills as you go along.
            Your old skills will still come in handy.</aside>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3 class="pro">Pros</h3>
          <p><strong>Easy to develop</strong> - No compilation, wide choice of languages</p>

          <aside class="notes">While native apps usually use compiled languages
            like Java and Swift, web apps are mostly written in interpreted languages.
            This means you can refresh your browser, and the changes made to the
            code are reflected immediately in your website. In addition, remember that
            for backends you can choose pretty much any language you're comfortable with
            and there will be a web framework for it.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3 class="con">Cons</h3>
          <p><strong>No direct hardware access</strong> - weaker API, poor performance</p>

          <aside class="notes">The most obvious downside for web apps is the lack of 
            native hardware access. Native refers to the actual hardware the browser 
            your user is using - be it a desktop computer, a tablet, or a mobile phone.
            You're building on top of the browser, not the native platform itself.</aside>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3 class="con">Cons</h3>
          <p>Weaker and inconsistent API</p>
          <img src="img/caniuse-webrtc.png" alt="caniuse.com showing inconsistent support from Safari for WebRTC">
          
          <aside class="notes">That means what you get access to is generally 
            a subset of what native apps have access to. For example,
            the HTML5 WebRTC API does not give you camera FOV, which limits their
            application for AR.</aside>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3 class="con">Cons</h3>
          <p>(Relatively) poor performance</p>

          <aside class="notes">The browser itself also adds overhead. While most
            apps don't <em>need</em> every CPU cycle their device can give, and performance
            has improved significantly, you still don't want to build performance
            sensitive apps such as games in the browser.</aside>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3 class="con">Cons</h3>
          <p>Non-native UI</p>
          
          <img src="img/ios-blur.jpg" alt="">

          <aside class="notes">Your UI also won't look like the native platform's.
            Sure, you can <em>mimic</em> the native UI, but that usually a lost
            cause - you can never match the efficiency of native UI, and some
            UI elements like the blur and vibrancy effect on iOS is absolutely
            impossible to achieve in the browser.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3 class="con">Cons</h3>
          <p><strong>Fast changing</strong> - short knowledge lifespan</p>

          <aside class="notes">The web moves fast - <em>really</em> fast. That's good,
            because you get better technology, better performance, but it also means 
            what you learned here may not be relevant in a few year's time.</aside>
