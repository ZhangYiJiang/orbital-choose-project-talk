            comes to the type of project you can choose to build. We know that every project

          <aside class="notes">So let's get to it. Orbital is quite flexible when it

            Rank them according to what you think is important, then see how closely
            the project type you're thinking of matches up.</aside>

          <h3>Reach and accessibility</h3> 
          <p>Who can access or use your project, and is it easy to do so?</p>
          
          <aside class="notes">Reach and accessibility is important if you're 
            building you actually want people to use. It's less important if
            your project is a toy project or a portfolio piece. In general,
            the more platforms your app is on, and the less steps there are
            before the user can actually get productive with it - for instance, 
            require creating an account or installing something, the more likely
            it is for them to actually use your app.</aside>

        <section>
          <h3>Educational</h3>
          <p>What do you learn from building the project?</p>
          
          <aside class="notes">For many of you this will be your first time 
            building an actual app, so it's good to consider what you yourself
            will get out of the experience. Also consider how the project will
            look in your resume or portfolio. If this is not a 'real' app, you 
            can take more liberty in choosing the newest technology, instead of
            something realistic.</aside>

          <h3>Development experience</h3>
          <p>Is it fun or easy to build? Is it expensive?</p>

            should also be taken into account.</aside>

          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <p><strong>Accessible</strong> - No installation required</p>
          
          <aside class="notes">There's also no need to install anything, which is great
            because the biggest barrier to users these days is installing the app,
            and creating an account. Web apps just removed one of the two steps.</aside>
